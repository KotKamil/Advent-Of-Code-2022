# Advent of Code 2022
My attempt on solving puzzles from  [Advent Calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
I will try to solve the ones that were too hard at a time on a later date.
## How to set up
> You must have node.js installed 
```
npm install
cd <puzzle name>
npx nodemon index.js
```
Local server should start
